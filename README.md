=========

A small eclipse plugin that will align the equals signs on multiple lines and align words on multiple lines in columns.

*Update*
I added a new small feature to the plugin - a command that will move the cursor to the opening brace of the scope that the cursor is currently in. Both round and curly braces are considered. The command is bound to Ctrl+5 by default
